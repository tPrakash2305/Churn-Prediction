## ❓ Top 5 Expected Questions & Answers

**Q1: Why XGBoost over others?**
A: "Best performance: 76% accuracy, 0.624 F1-Score. Gradient boosting handles non-linear patterns better."

**Q2: How does SHAP work?**
A: "SHAP calculates each feature's contribution to prediction - explains WHY customer might churn."

**Q3: Is 76% accuracy good enough?**
A: "Yes, industry standard is 70-80%. Our 65.5% recall catches 2 out of 3 churners."

**Q4: Production deployment?**
A: "Yes! Models serialized with joblib, Streamlit frontend, can deploy on AWS/Azure/Heroku."

**Q5: Business impact?**
A: "Retaining 10% of predicted churners = $175K saved annually (assuming $500 lifetime value)."
