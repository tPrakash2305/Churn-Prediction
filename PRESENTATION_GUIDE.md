## 🎯 Questions Faculty Might Ask (Be Prepared!)

### **Technical Questions:**

1. **Q: Why did you choose these three models?**
   A: "Logistic Regression as baseline, Random Forest for non-linear patterns, XGBoost for best performance through gradient boosting. This combination covers simple to complex modeling approaches."

2. **Q: How did you handle class imbalance?**
   A: "We used SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) during training to balance the classes. Original ratio was 74:26, SMOTE created synthetic samples of minority class."

3. **Q: What is SHAP and why is it important?**
   A: "SHAP calculates each feature's contribution to predictions. It's crucial for business trust - we can explain WHY a customer might churn, not just predict it."

4. **Q: How do you prevent overfitting?**
   A: "Cross-validation during training, train-test split (80-20), regularization in models, and monitoring both training and test performance."

5. **Q: What is F1-Score and why is it important here?**
   A: "F1-Score is the harmonic mean of Precision and Recall. It's important because we need balance - can't miss churners (high recall) but also can't have too many false alarms (high precision)."

### **Business Questions:**

1. **Q: How can businesses use this system?**
   A: "Businesses can: 1) Score all customers monthly, 2) Target high-risk customers with retention offers, 3) Analyze churn patterns to fix root causes, 4) Calculate ROI of retention campaigns."

2. **Q: What's the cost-benefit of this system?**
   A: "If we retain even 10% of predicted churners, and each customer has $500 lifetime value, for 7,000 customers that's potentially $175,000 saved annually."

3. **Q: How accurate is 76%? Is that good enough?**
   A: "76% accuracy is strong for churn prediction. More importantly, 65.5% recall means we catch 2 out of 3 churning customers. Industry benchmarks range from 70-80%, so we're competitive."

### **Implementation Questions:**

1. **Q: How long does training take?**
   A: "Training all three models takes approximately 2-3 minutes on standard hardware. XGBoost is the slowest but most accurate."

2. **Q: Can this be deployed in production?**
   A: "Yes! The system is production-ready. Models are serialized using joblib, the web interface is built with Streamlit, and it can be deployed on cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, or Heroku."

3. **Q: How often should models be retrained?**
   A: "Quarterly or when performance drops. We monitor prediction accuracy on new data and retrain when drift is detected."

### **Dataset Questions:**

1. **Q: What are the key features that predict churn?**
   A: "Top predictors include: Contract type (month-to-month highest risk), Tenure (new customers more likely), Internet service type, Monthly charges, and Tech support usage."

2. **Q: How many records do you have?**
   A: "7,021 customers after data cleaning. Original dataset had 7,043 but we removed records with missing values."

3. **Q: Is this real-world data?**
   A: "Yes, it's the Telco Customer Churn dataset, a real telecommunications company dataset widely used for educational and research purposes."
