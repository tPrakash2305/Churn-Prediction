## Quick Start

### 1. Clone or Download the Project

```bash
cd DMBI_MiniProject
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Download Dataset

Download the **Telco Customer Churn** dataset from Kaggle:

- Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn
- Place the `WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn.csv` file in `data/raw/` folder
- Rename it to `telco_churn.csv`

### 4. Train the Model

```bash
python src/train.py
```

This will:

- Load and preprocess the data
- Train multiple models
- Save the best model and preprocessor
- Generate evaluation reports

### 5. Run the Streamlit Dashboard

```bash
streamlit run app/app.py
```

The dashboard will open in your browser at `http://localhost:8501`
