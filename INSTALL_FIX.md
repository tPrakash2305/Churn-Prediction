# ✅ ISSUE RESOLVED - Python 3.13 Compatibility Fix

## 🎉 **SUCCESS! All Packages Installed**

---

## 📋 **What Was The Problem?**

**Error:** `pip._vendor.pyproject_hooks._impl.BackendUnavailable: Cannot import 'setuptools.build_meta'`

**Root Cause:**

- Python 3.13 has stricter requirements for package building
- Old versions in requirements.txt weren't fully compatible
- setuptools needed to be upgraded first

### 1. Created Virtual Environment

- ✅ Virtual environment created: `.venv`
- ✅ Using Python 3.13.1

### 2. Upgraded Build Tools

- ✅ pip upgraded to 25.0.1
- ✅ setuptools upgraded to 80.9.0
- ✅ wheel upgraded to 0.45.1

### 3. Updated Requirements

- ✅ Changed from exact versions (==) to minimum versions (>=)
- ✅ Updated XGBoost to 2.0.0+ (Python 3.13 compatible)
- ✅ Updated all packages to latest compatible versions

### 4. Installed All Packages ✅

```
✅ pandas (2.2.3)
✅ numpy (2.2.3)
✅ matplotlib (3.10.1)
✅ seaborn (0.13.2)
✅ scikit-learn (1.7.2)
✅ xgboost (3.0.5) ⭐ Latest version!
✅ imbalanced-learn (0.14.0)
✅ shap (0.49.1)

## 🚀 **How to Use the Project Now**

### ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Always Activate Virtual Environment

Since we're using a virtual environment, you need to activate it before running any commands.

### Option 1: PowerShell (Recommended)

```powershell
# Activate virtual environment
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# Now you can use normal commands
python verify_setup.py
python src/train.py
streamlit run app/app.py
```

### Option 2: Use Full Path

```powershell
# Without activating, use full path
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe verify_setup.py
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe src/train.py
.\.venv\Scripts\streamlit.exe run app/app.py
```

---

## 📊 **Current Status**

### ✅ Completed

- [x] Virtual environment created
- [x] All Python packages installed (11/11)
- [x] Compatibility issues resolved
- [x] Ready for dataset and training

### ⚠️ Still Needed

- [ ] Download dataset from Kaggle
- [ ] Train the models
- [ ] Launch dashboard

---

## 🎯 **Next Steps**

### Step 1: Activate Virtual Environment

```powershell
cd "c:\Users\PRAKASH THAPA\Desktop\DMBI_MiniProject"
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

You'll see `(.venv)` in your prompt when activated.

### Step 2: Download Dataset (3-5 minutes)

1. Visit: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn
2. Download CSV file
3. Rename to: `telco_churn.csv`
4. Place in: `data/raw/telco_churn.csv`

### Step 3: Train Models (3-5 minutes)

```powershell
python src/train.py
```

### Step 4: Launch Dashboard (10 seconds)

```powershell
streamlit run app/app.py
```

## 📝 **Updated Requirements File**

The `requirements.txt` has been updated to:

```
# Core Data Science Libraries (Python 3.13 compatible)
pandas>=2.0.0
numpy>=1.24.0
matplotlib>=3.7.0
seaborn>=0.12.0

# Machine Learning
scikit-learn>=1.3.0
xgboost>=2.0.0  # ⭐ Updated for Python 3.13
imbalanced-learn>=0.11.0

# Model Explainability
shap>=0.44.0

# Web Framework
streamlit>=1.25.0

# Model Persistence
joblib>=1.3.0

# Utilities
plotly>=5.15.0
```

---

## 🔍 **Verification**

### Check Installed Packages

```powershell
# Activate environment first
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# Check specific packages
python -c "import pandas; print(f'pandas: {pandas.__version__}')"
python -c "import numpy; print(f'numpy: {numpy.__version__}')"
python -c "import sklearn; print(f'scikit-learn: {sklearn.__version__}')"
python -c "import xgboost; print(f'xgboost: {xgboost.__version__}')"
python -c "import shap; print(f'shap: {shap.__version__}')"
python -c "import streamlit; print(f'streamlit: {streamlit.__version__}')"
```

Expected output:

```
pandas: 2.2.3
numpy: 2.2.3
scikit-learn: 1.7.2
xgboost: 3.0.5
shap: 0.49.1
streamlit: 1.44.1
```

## 💡 **Tips**

### Always Use Virtual Environment

```powershell
# Start of every session
cd "c:\Users\PRAKASH THAPA\Desktop\DMBI_MiniProject"
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# Now all commands work normally
python src/train.py
streamlit run app/app.py
```

### Deactivate When Done

```powershell
deactivate
```

### If Activation Fails

If you get a script execution error:

```powershell
# Run this once as Administrator
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

Then try activating again.
