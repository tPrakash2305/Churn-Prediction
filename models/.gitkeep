# Models Directory

This directory stores trained machine learning models and preprocessing pipelines.

## Files Generated After Training:

- `model.joblib` - Best performing model pipeline
- `preproc.joblib` - Preprocessing pipeline (optional separate save)
- `all_results.joblib` - All model training results for comparison

## Usage:

These files are automatically generated when you run:

```
python src/train.py
```

The Streamlit app loads the model from this directory to make predictions.

**Note:** Model files are large and excluded from version control via `.gitignore`
